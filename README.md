## üí° Implementation Challenges & Solutions

### Undo/Redo Functionality
Implemented a robust history tracking system using React's Context API to maintain the state of the canvas at different points in time, enabling seamless undo and redo operations.

### Eraser Tool
Created a custom solution for detecting intersections between the eraser path and existing elements on the canvas, with special handling for different element types.

### Text Component Erasure
Developed a specialized approach to handle text element erasure, which required different logic than shape-based elements due to their complex rendering properties.
